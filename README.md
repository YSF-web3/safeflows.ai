## 🛠️ Core Features

### 🤖 Model Context Protocol (MCP) for DeFi Risk Analysis

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is our advanced AI conversation management system that powers SafeFlows.ai's risk analysis capabilities. It maintains contextual awareness across multiple interactions while integrating Solend protocol data with AI-powered insights.

#### Key Features
- **Solend Integration**: Direct connection to Solend's lending protocol metrics
- **Risk-Aware Context**: Maintains awareness of user's positions, market conditions, and risk thresholds
- **Multi-Model Analysis**: Combines insights from GPT and Deepseek models for comprehensive risk assessment
- **Persistent Memory**: Remembers user preferences and past risk assessments
- **Automated Monitoring**: Continuous analysis of lending positions with smart alerts

#### Example Use Cases
```typescript
// Initialize risk monitoring conversation
POST /api/mcp/conversation
{
  "modelId": "gpt-4",
  "modelType": "gpt",
  "systemPrompt": "You are a DeFi risk analyst monitoring Solend positions",
  "parameters": {
    "riskThreshold": 0.75,
    "monitoredAssets": ["SOL", "ETH", "USDC"],
    "alertLevel": "conservative"
  }
}

// Query position health
POST /api/mcp/conversation/:contextId/message
{
  "message": "Analyze my SOL-USDC position's liquidation risk",
  "context": {
    "position": {
      "collateral": "SOL",
      "borrowed": "USDC",
      "ltv": 0.65,
      "healthFactor": 1.4
    },
    "market": {
      "volatility": "high",
      "trend": "bearish"
    }
  }
}

// Get risk analysis history
GET /api/mcp/conversation/:contextId/history

### 🚨 Real-Time Risk Scoring (RTRS)
* **Easily assess lending pool risks** with AI-driven models analyzing:
   * Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios.
   * Collateral volatility and liquidation trends.
   * Market conditions to generate real-time risk scores (1–100).
* **Interactive Heatmaps** make lending pool health easy to understand:
   * **Green (1–40)**: Low risk.
   * **Yellow (41–70)**: Moderate risk.
   * **Red (71–100)**: High risk.

### 📊 Collateral Health Monitoring (CHM)
* Stay on top of your collateralized assets with live updates and alerts:
**Health Factor (HF)**: Monitors asset health using:
```makefile
HF = Collateral Value ÷ Borrowed Value
```

* **Proactive Alerts**: Warn you of potential liquidation risks.
* **Dashboards**: Display key metrics at a glance:
   * Collateral value.
   * Borrowed value.
   * **Color-coded HF indicators**:
      * Green: Safe.
      * Yellow: At risk.
      * Red: Critical.

### ⚙️ Customizable Risk Settings
* Fine-tune your experience:
   * Adjust risk tolerance to Low, Medium, or High.
   * Set personalized alerts based on your trading preferences.
   * Use pre-built strategies or design custom ones for optimal portfolio management.
