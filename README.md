## Core Features 🛠️  

### 🚨 Real-Time Risk Scoring (RTRS)  
Easily assess lending pool risks with AI-driven models that analyze:  
- Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios.  
- Collateral volatility and liquidation trends.  
- Market conditions to generate a real-time risk score (1–100).  

**Interactive heatmaps** make it easy to see the health of lending pools:  
- **Green (1–40)**: Low risk.  
- **Yellow (41–70)**: Moderate risk.  
- **Red (71–100)**: High risk.

### 📊 Collateral Health Monitoring (CHM)  
Stay on top of your collateralized assets with live updates and alerts:  
- **Health Factor (HF)**: Monitors the health of your assets using:  
  \[
  \text{HF} = \frac{\text{Collateral Value}}{\text{Borrowed Value}}
  \]  
- **Proactive Alerts**: Warn you before liquidation risks, so you have time to act.  
- **Dashboards**: Provide all the key metrics at a glance:  
  - Collateral value.  
  - Borrowed value.  
  - Color-coded HF indicators:  
    - **Green**: Safe.  
    - **Yellow**: At-risk.  
    - **Red**: Critical.
